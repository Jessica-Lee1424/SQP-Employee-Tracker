## Description
The goal of this project is to create command-line application that accepts user input to view a series of options pertaining to company employees. When executed successfully, the user will be presented with a series of options such as view departments, roles, and employees, as well as options to add new entries to each.
A particular challenge was a consistent error when running node app.js in the command line and receiving an error that the tables were not created. This was resolved by running the schema.sql and seeds.sql directly in the command line terminal. 
As a result of this challenge, I became much more familiar with postgres and how to troubleshoot using pg4admin.
